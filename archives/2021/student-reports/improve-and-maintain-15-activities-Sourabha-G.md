## My work in project

My work mostly revolved around adding basic game design features, porting activities to python3, testing the activities in the development environment and user environment(kids). Project also included adding and fetching new translations, fixing flake8 errors and other issues that blocked new releases, and making new releases.<ul><li>Game design features included altering the game flow by adding,<ol><li>A scoring system</li><li>Timer or stopwatch as a parameter to gauge win/lose(if there was no scope for score and highscore)</li><li>Levels</li><li> Displaying a UI that shows win/lose, score and highscore, replay prompt(or automatic restart of game)</li><li>Storing the game data that is used in each instance of the activity</li></ol><li>Porting activities to python3, Sugargame-v1.3</li><li>Enable player to resume the game from `Journal`</li><li>Test and fix logical errors in the game.</li></ul>

## Personal note

This summer was super fun and filled with learning! I enjoyed testing over 60+ activities with kids to get first-hand feedback which had a positive impact in the way they approach problems. The fact that these activities are used by kids as a tool of learning motivates me to contribute more and more. I'm going to continue to contribute and be a part of Sugar Labs. Special thanks to my mentors and [James Cameron](https://github.com/quozl) for helping a lot in the initial stages to understand the codebase. A big thanks to this community which has helped to shape a lot of young lives. Lastly, thanks to Google for this wonderful initiative :)

*Cheers!*
