## Personal note

With GSoC'22 coming to an end, I'd like to thank my mentors [Ibiam Chihurumnaya](https://github.com/chimosky/), [Srevin Saju](https://github.com/srevinsaju) and [James Cameron](https://github.com/quozl) for guiding me all along. This summer was a little challenging with UPs and DOWNs (due to graduation and job) yet open source contribution has always been fun for me and I'd lke to continue contributing.

*Cheers!*
